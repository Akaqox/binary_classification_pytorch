## ðŸ’¾ **ABOUT**

<p>While starting this project my objective was learning Pytorch library. On the .py files, I give attention to project layout, as addition on class and functions type hinting method used </p>
<p>While implementing classes and functions, I tried to morely classes for clean code and readibility. Some implementated properties are metrics, plot loss and acc, train class, evalutation class, dataset class, early stopping, saving best model, </p>


My dataset is:

## Project Structure

The project is organized with careful attention to layout and readability. The following key components have been implemented:

- **Classes and Functions with Type Hinting:** The codebase extensively uses type hinting for better code clarity and maintenance.
- **Metric Tracking:** Implementations for tracking key metrics such as loss and accuracy during model training and evaluation.
- **Plotting:** Functions to visualize training progress, including loss and accuracy plots.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Separate classes for handling the training loop and model evaluation, promoting modularity and reuse.
- **Dataset Handling:** Custom dataset classes to manage data loading and preprocessing efficiently.
- **Early Stopping:** Implementation of early stopping to prevent overfitting by halting training when performance stops improving.
- **Model Checkpointing:** Automatically saving the best model during training based on evaluation metrics.
- **Model Classes:** Various model architectures implemented using PyTorch's `nn.Module`.
